# Lesson 1: Foundational Concepts

**Duration:** 90 minutes (lecture + discussion)  
**Level:** Undergraduate/Graduate  
**Language:** English (Spanish translation in progress)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Define peace in its negative and positive dimensions
- Distinguish between conflict, violence, and structural inequality
- Introduce key peace research frameworks and methodologies
- Explore the relationship between justice and peacebuilding

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is Peace?

Peace is not merely the absence of direct violence. The peace and conflict field distinguishes between:

**Negative Peace:** The cessation of direct violence—wars, armed conflicts, physical harm.

**Positive Peace:** The presence of social justice, equity, reconciliation, and conditions enabling human flourishing.

Johan Galtung's foundational distinction (1969) shifts focus from conflict termination alone to building systems that prevent violence from recurring.

### 2. Structural Violence

Structural violence refers to harm embedded in social systems—poverty, discrimination, lack of access to healthcare or education. These "quiet" forms of violence cause suffering without direct physical assault, yet they constrain human potential.

Understanding structural violence is critical to explaining why treaties or ceasefires alone cannot create sustainable peace.

### 3. Conflict as Process

Conflict is a natural social phenomenon arising from incompatible interests, needs, or values. It is not inherently destructive—its transformation depends on:

- The parties' willingness to engage constructively
- The availability of dialogue and mediation mechanisms
- Institutional frameworks supporting negotiation
- Economic and social conditions enabling cooperation

## Frameworks for Analysis

### The ABC Triangle (Galtung)

A framework for understanding conflict dynamics:

- **A (Attitude):** Subjective perceptions, beliefs, stereotypes
- **B (Behavior):** Actions—cooperation, hostility, violence
- **C (Contradiction):** Structural incompatibilities or competing interests

Peacebuilding requires addressing all three: changing perceptions, shifting behavior, and resolving underlying contradictions.

### Conflict Transformation

Rather than simply "resolving" conflict by choosing a winner, conflict transformation seeks to:

- Shift the nature of the relationship between parties
- Address root causes of incompatibility
- Create new institutional or social contexts
- Foster mutual understanding and respect

This approach is distinct from conflict resolution (finding a settlement) and conflict management (controlling escalation).

## Discussion Questions

1. How would you distinguish between a peace agreement that is merely a ceasefire and one that achieves "positive peace"?
2. What examples of structural violence exist in your own community or familiar contexts?
3. Can conflict ever be beneficial? What conditions would make conflict transformation successful?
4. How do media narratives shape attitudes toward conflict and the opposing party?

## Key Readings

### Required

- Galtung, J. (1969). "Violence, Peace, and Peace Research." *Journal of Peace Research*, 6(3), 167–191.
- Lederach, J. P. (1997). *Building Peace: Sustainable Reconciliation in Divided Societies.* USIP Press. [Introduction chapter]

### Recommended

- Ramsbotham, O., Miall, H., & Woodhouse, T. (2011). *Contemporary Conflict Resolution.* Polity Press. [Chapters 1–2]
- Sen, A. (1999). *Development as Freedom.* Oxford University Press. [Chapter 4: "Freedoms and Needs"]

## Activities

### Activity 1: Mapping Conflict Dimensions (30 minutes)

**Instructions:**

1. Work in small groups (3–4 students)
2. Choose a contemporary or historical conflict
3. Map it using Galtung's ABC triangle:
   - **C (Contradiction):** What are the underlying structural incompatibilities? (territory, resources, identity, governance)
   - **B (Behavior):** What hostile or violent actions are visible?
   - **A (Attitude):** What perceptions, stereotypes, or narratives persist?
4. Propose an intervention for each dimension

**Example:** Israeli-Palestinian Conflict
- **C:** Competition for land, resources, self-determination, recognition
- **B:** Military operations, settlements, rocket attacks, protests
- **A:** Historical grievances, identity threats, enemy stereotypes, competing narratives about legitimacy

**Deliverable:** A visual diagram or one-page summary

### Activity 2: Positive Peace in Practice (20 minutes)

**Instructions:**

1. Research a peacebuilding organization working in a post-conflict region (e.g., Rwanda, Northern Ireland, Colombia)
2. Identify their programs and approaches
3. Analyze:
   - How do they address both negative peace (stopping violence) and positive peace (building justice and reconciliation)?
   - What structural barriers do they face?
   - What evidence suggests their work is sustainable?

**Discussion:** Share findings and reflect on the relationship between justice, reconciliation, and peace.

## Preparation

### Before Class

- Read Galtung (1969) and *Building Peace* introduction
- Think of one example of conflict from your personal experience or news

### Materials Needed

- Whiteboard/markers for mapping exercises
- Projector for slides
- Handout: Galtung's ABC triangle template

## Assessment

Students will be assessed on:

- **Participation:** Engagement in discussion and group activities
- **Concept Mapping:** Accurate application of the ABC framework
- **Reflection:** Thoughtful responses to discussion questions

## Notes for Instructors

- This lesson introduces foundational concepts; deeper exploration of frameworks occurs in subsequent sessions
- Use case studies relevant to students' regions and interests
- Emphasize that peace research is both academic and practical—many frameworks originated in peacebuilding practice
- Encourage students to connect concepts to their own contexts
