1. Define peace and conflict within academic and policy contexts
2. Analyze conflicts using multiple frameworks (ABC triangle, conflict mapping, etc.)
3. Distinguish between conflict resolution, management, and transformation
4. Apply peace research methodologies to contemporary case studies
5. Design peacebuilding interventions addressing both negative and positive peace
