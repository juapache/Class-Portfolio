This directory contains assignment prompts, rubrics, and assessment materials for the course.

## Assignment 1: Conflict Mapping Analysis

**Due:** Week 3  
**Length:** 3–4 pages  
**Format:** Written analysis + visual diagram

### Prompt

Select a conflict from the list below (or with instructor approval, propose your own). Using Galtung's ABC triangle framework, provide a comprehensive analysis of the conflict dynamics:

**A (Attitude):** Describe the perceptions, beliefs, and narratives held by different parties. What stereotypes or historical grievances persist?

**B (Behavior):** Document the hostile or violent actions taken by each party. What patterns do you observe?

**C (Contradiction):** Identify the structural incompatibilities underlying the conflict. What material or ideational interests are at stake?

**Intervention Design:** For each dimension (A, B, C), propose an intervention that a peacebuilder might undertake. How would addressing all three dimensions differ from addressing only one?

### Suggested Conflicts

- Israeli-Palestinian conflict
- Myanmar (Rohingya crisis)
- South Sudan civil war
- Northern Ireland (historical)
- Colombia (drug trafficking and armed groups)
- Ukraine-Russia conflict

## Assignment 2: Peacebuilding Organization Case Study

**Due:** Week 6  
**Length:** 4–5 pages  
**Format:** Written analysis

### Prompt

Research a peacebuilding organization or initiative working in a post-conflict or ongoing-conflict region. Examples include:

- [International Crisis Group](https://www.crisisgroup.org/) (multi-regional analysis)
- [Conciliation Resources](https://www.c-r.org/) (UK-based; global work)
- [Search for Common Ground](https://www.sfcg.org/) (media and dialogue)
- [Mercy Corps](https://www.mercycorps.org/) (development + peacebuilding)
- Local or regional organizations (with instructor approval)

### Required Analysis

1. **Organization Profile:** Mission, funding, geographic scope, staff expertise
2. **Programs:** Description of 2–3 major peacebuilding initiatives
3. **Negative vs. Positive Peace:** How do their programs address:
   - Stopping direct violence (negative peace)?
   - Building justice, reconciliation, and structural change (positive peace)?
4. **Barriers & Challenges:** What structural, political, or resource constraints do they face?
5. **Evidence of Impact:** What metrics or evidence suggest their work is effective? What limitations exist in measuring peacebuilding outcomes?
6. **Critical Reflection:** What would you change or improve in their approach?

### Evaluation Rubric

| Criterion | Excellent | Good | Satisfactory | Needs Improvement |
|-----------|-----------|------|---------------|--------------------|
| **Research Depth** | Thorough investigation; multiple sources | Good research; adequate sources | Basic research; limited sources | Minimal research |
| **Negative vs. Positive Peace** | Clear distinction; thoughtful analysis | Clear distinction; mostly accurate | Basic distinction; some clarity | Unclear or incomplete |
| **Critical Analysis** | Insightful evaluation; acknowledges trade-offs | Good analysis; recognizes complexity | Basic analysis; surface-level | Superficial critique |
| **Evidence & Citations** | Well-sourced; proper citations | Generally well-sourced | Adequate citations | Poor or missing citations |
